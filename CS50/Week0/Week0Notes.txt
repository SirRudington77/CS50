Functions - actions or words that let you do things within the program

Arguments - input to a function that influences its behaviour

SyntaxError - have a mistake at the keyboard

Variables - stores values within the computer

Comments - notes to yourself within your code

Pseudocode - using language to explain your code. This is a good way to structure your code in order to lay out everything that is needed to be used.
    EX. 
    # Ask user for their name 

    # Say hello to the user

    Having this laid out prior to actually putting the code can help build the strucure on how you want to create the code. 
    EX.
    # Ask user for their name 
    name = input("What is your name?")

    # Say hello to the user
    print("Hello, " + name)
	
String Manipulation
	# Remove whitespace from str
	name = name.strip()
	
	#Splitting names, this will seperate it from 2 names
	first, last = name.split(" ")
	
Interger (whole numbers)
    + = addition
    - = subtraction
    * = multiplication
    / = division
