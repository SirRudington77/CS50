 This matches whatever the variable is to the items within the cases.
 
 match (variable):
	If the variable is equivalent to the item then it will execute the line of code within that case
	case (item):
		print (string)
	case (item):
		print (string)
	case (item):
		print (string)
	The _ plays as a catch all in where if the variable is not within any of the cases that are already in place, execute what is within the case.
	case _:
		print (string)
	The | allows you to condense the case in where it can check all of the items within the one case line and be able to execute the code within the case.
	case (item) | (item):
		print (string)
